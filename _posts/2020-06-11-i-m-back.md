After taking a rather long hiatus, I'm back, with a new project! I'll write about it in a different post, but first, I need to reorganize this blog a bit.

When I created this blog, it only contained a `index.html` file and a `_config.yml` file. `index.html` is a simple page with static content, not really suited for displaying multiple posts. I could of course just add the new post at the beginning of the `index` file, but that would lead to a gigantic single file which would be hard to manage, I imagine.

Jekyll allows to separate posts each in its own file in a `_posts` folder. The first step should then be to just create the folder and move the previous `index` file there, renaming it along the way to match to satisfy conventions. Sounds easy enough, make all the changes, `git push`, the new site is deployed, and tadaa!

File not found

The site configured at this address does not contain the requested file.

If this is your site, make sure that the filename case matches the URL.
For root URLs (like http://example.com/) you must provide an index.html file. 
```

Well. That's not what I was expecting. Apparently, the `index.html` file is indeed mandatory.
